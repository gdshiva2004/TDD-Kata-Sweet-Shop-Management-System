📦 Installation
1. Clone
git clone <repo-url>
cd SweetShop

2. Backend Setup
cd backend
npm install


Create .env:

PORT=4000
MONGO_URI=<your-mongo-uri>
JWT_SECRET=<your-secret>
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d


Start backend:

npm start

3. Frontend Setup
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

🔐 Creating an Admin User

Run:

node scripts/createAdmin.js


This generates an admin directly inside MongoDB.

🧠 My AI Usage (Required Section)

This project includes a dedicated section describing how AI tools were used, per the assignment requirement.

🔧 Tools Used

ChatGPT (GPT-4/GPT-4.1/GPT-5)

GitHub Copilot (occasionally)

Gemini (optional: include only if you actually used it)

🧩 How I Used AI
1. ChatGPT — Primary Development Assistant

I used ChatGPT extensively during this project for the following:

Debugging backend API issues

Designing the MongoDB schema structure

Implementing JWT authentication logic

Generating React component structures (Navbar, SweetCard, AdminPanel, Cart page)

Creating CSS-in-JS styling

Writing animations using Anime.js

Creating the Cart system architecture (CartContext, useCart hook)

Implementing optimistic UI updates and animations

Generating commit messages in RED/GREEN/REFACTOR format

Designing helper scripts like createAdmin.js

Writing README documentation

Most importantly:
I treated ChatGPT like a senior engineer reviewing my work.
I iterated, tested, asked for fixes, and refined until the code met requirements.

2. GitHub Copilot — Inline Suggestions

I used Copilot for:

Auto-completing repetitive React boilerplate

Speeding up writing effect hooks & small utility functions

Suggesting Mongoose model field types

Copilot was used passively (inline suggestions), while ChatGPT was used purposefully (intentional queries).

🪞 Reflection: How AI Impacted My Workflow

Using AI significantly accelerated development and improved structure. Key benefits:

Faster debugging: I resolved issues like route mismatches, context errors, and API response structure much faster.

Cleaner architecture: AI helped design a modular Cart system and admin panel.

Better UI/UX: Anime.js animations and component polish were AI-guided.

Learning boost: I deepened understanding of JWT, React Context, optimistic UI, and Express routing.

However:

I did not blindly copy AI output; I manually reviewed and modified everything.

Several bugs required real debugging, experimenting, and verifying logic myself.

AI was used as an assistant, not a replacement for my own reasoning.
